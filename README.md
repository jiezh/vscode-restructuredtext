  To trigger snippets, please refer to [Visual Studio Code shortcuts](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/customization/keybindings).
  
- Live Preview (Experimental, and **Sphinx must be configured in advanced**)

  The shortcuts are

  - `ctrl+shift+r`      Preview
  - `ctrl+k r`          Preview to Side

>**Notice:** The preview feature requires Python to be installed. The `sphinx` Python module is also required. 
Check out the [steps to configure sphinx](docs/sphinx.md).

- Linter (Experimental, and **restructuredtext-lint must be configured in advanced**)

>**Notice:** The linter feature requires `restructuredtext-lint` Python module. 
Check out the [steps to configure sphinx](docs/sphinx.md).
Due to the facts that `restructuredtext-lint` does not support all Sphinx directives, there can be many false positives in its ouput.

### Live Preview
The initial idea was brought from [Thomas Haakon Townsend's ReStructured Text Previewer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tht13.rst-vscode), but soon after moving fully to Sphinx, this extension becomes its own beast.
